Bitbot is a working usable example implementation of the Mt Gox JSON trading API in Python
API docs for Mt Gox can be found here: https://mtgox.com/support/tradeAPI

Usage:
Edit bitbot.conf.distrib and put in your details, then save it as bitbot.conf and 'python bitbot.py'

NOTE:
If you're going to work on this and make commits, you'll want to 'mv dot.gitignore .gitignore' so you don't commit your own conf with your username / password or your sqlite logging database!
